🔐 Vaultara — Secure File Encryption

Vaultara is a lightweight, browser-based file encryption tool that makes securing your files simple and stylish.

✨ Features:

AES-256-GCM Encryption — industry-standard, strong symmetric encryption.

Password + Key Protection — uses PBKDF2 with SHA-256 to derive encryption keys, ensuring files stay secure even if the key alone is compromised.

Encrypt & Decrypt Any File (≤25MB) — works for text, images, videos, source code, or anything else.

No Server Required — all encryption/decryption happens in the browser via Web Crypto API.

Optional Cloud Storage (12h expiry) — for temporary file sharing, using free tiers of providers like Supabase or Firebase.

Beautiful UI — inspired by Apple’s “liquid glass” design, with smooth micro-interactions.
